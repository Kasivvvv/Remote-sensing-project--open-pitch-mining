                <p>Open-cast mining operations constitute a significant component of the Polish economy, providing approximately 40 different mineral resources that are essential for various industries. This extraction is facilitated by over 6,000 mining facilities across the country, collectively yielding minerals and mineral by-products.
Open-pit mining has profound and enduring consequences for the landscape and ecosystems in affected regions. The most visible long-term effect is often a drastically altered landscape, characterized by large, excavated pits and extensive waste piles that can persist indefinitely. These waste piles can pose a long-term threat to the environment due to the potential for leaching toxic materials into the soil and water for generations.</p>
<p>The project aims to detect and monitor open-cast mining sites using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2. Research focused on identifying active and abandoned mining areas, tracking changes in mining activity from year to year, and assessing environmental impacts.</p>
<p>The Sentinel-2 satellite, a key instrument in the study, is equipped with advanced multispectral optical sensors capable of monitoring land use and land cover changes with high precision. These sensors include the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), and the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI). The study utilised these indices to analyse land cover classification, vegetation health assessment, and changes in vegetation extent. The NDVI, a key metric in vegetation health assessment, is employed to detect stress and loss in vegetation by measuring the difference between near-infrared and red reflectance. The Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) facilitates the identification of built-up and barren land by analysing shortwave infrared and near-infrared reflectance.The Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) enhances the detection of water bodies by utilising shortwave infrared and green band data, which is crucial for the assessment of water contamination and changes in hydrological conditions in mining regions.</p>
<p>Additionally, radar data from Sentinel-1 was used to improve surface deformation and excavation monitoring. Sentinel-1, with its synthetic aperture radar (SAR) capabilities, enables effective tracking of land surface changes, subsidence, and excavation progress. The analysis compared multi-temporal Sentinel-2 images with Very High-Resolution (VHR) SPOT data to detect land cover changes and analyzed radar backscatter variations in mining zones.</p>
<p>This application can be particularly beneficial for environmental agencies, governmental institutions, and mining companies, providing critical insights for sustainable resource management, environmental impact assessments, and regulatory compliance monitoring.</p>
